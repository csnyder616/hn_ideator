## A beautiful, highly opinionated project headline generator written in Ruby.

Anyone who regularly visits [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) has seen the *"Show HN: {proper noun} — a[n] {adjective} {noun} written in {trendy language}”* headlines. Inspired by a [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9280555) surmising that all HN project descriptions are really written by Markov chains, I decided to write a Twitter bot that generates “Show HN”-style headlines.

### Approach
Since this bot generates headlines (rather than the longer project descriptions the original author described), I decided that a Madlib-style approach would be appropriate. It follows the following pattern:

> Show HN: {proper noun} — a[n] {adjective} {noun} written in {language}

#### {proper noun}
The goal here was to create a new “word” to describe the project:

1. Word length picked at random
1. Random characters are selected; the random character picker biases towards consonants or vowels based on the previous character
1. Capitalize the first letter, as well as other characters at random for CamelCasing
1. Occasionally add a trendy suffix like *.ly*, *Box*, etc.

#### {adjective} and {noun}
Uses [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) to get random characters from the needed part of speech, using [indefinite_article](https://github.com/rossmeissl/indefinite_article) to add the article before the adjective

#### {language}
Picks a language at random from the included langs.txt. The languages were scraped (see the included prog_languages script) from the Wikipedia listings for [serious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) and [esoteric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) programming languages.

### Twitter
When called with the "post" command-line argument, the generated headline will be posted to Twitter. This requires Twitter API access and user authorization.
